# [One In The Chamber]
## About
"One In The Chamber" is a new game mode for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive laregely inspired by the game mode with the same name from the Call Of Duty series.
With "One In The Chamber" installed on the server players will spawn with nothing else than a pistol and a knife. The pistol can only contain one bullet, but the bullet always kill the enemy in the first shot.
If a player misses their shot, they have to rely on their knife in an attempt to secure a kill. Whenever a player manages to kill an enemy, the player will receive a bullet for their pistol. The first player to reach a certain amount of kills wins the round.


## Settings & Configuration Information



## Recommended Game Levels / Maps
This game mode is compatible with all of the maps in the current official map pool. The game mode can be played on any map, but when the free-for-all mode is enabled it is recommended to use maps that support the usage of random spawn locations. Fortunately, most maps already do this, this including all of the maps that have ever been part of the official map pool, and most maps in general, there may be a very few exceptions to this rule.
